The EMS framework is a forth inspired approach to developing devices built around microcontrollers in the real world. It consists of two major components. 

1. (EMS) A simple mechanism to communicate between the System In Control and the outside world. 

2. (CONSOLE) a cross platform interface (command line or graphical) with the ability to control, log and display the status of the devices subsystems and the ability to update the devices firmware. 

It has been developed around python and the arduino platform with an emphasis on the M0.
